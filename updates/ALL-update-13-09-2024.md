A huge thank you to all the participants in the LORO testnet; it was a great success with 127 participants earning points and becoming eligible for LNT allocation. The main goal of this testnet was to identify qualified Service Providers and begin onboarding them ahead of mainnet launch.

This process has begun and all participants that successfully completed Task 13 have been invited to complete KYC and continue with onboarding activities. **For participants that earned points but didn’t complete Task 13, you will receive an email to KYC in the coming weeks.**

Today we also announce the proposed token allocation formula for all testnet participants. This formula was created to reflect the goals of the testnet and reward active participants fairly. It allows participants to calculate their proposed LNT allocation.  
   
With a fixed total supply of 129,600 LNT, we’ve reserved 1/10th (12,960 LNT) for incentivized testnets.

The LORO testnet allocates a total of 4320 LNT. Individual allocations were based on the role you qualified for – through the tasks completed – and a performance multiplier based on the total testnet points earned:

Overall, 

* 3720 LNT is allocated to 45 Service Providers (completed Task 13\)  
* 600 LNT is allocated to 82 App Publishers (did not complete Task 13\)

Baseline allocations were set at

* 60 LNT for each Service Provider (total 2700 LNT)  
* 2 LNT for each App Publisher (total 164 LNT)

The remaining LNT for each role (1020 LNT for Service Providers, 436 LNT for App Publishers) was distributed based on performance. We calculated a performance multiplier for each role by dividing the remaining LNT by the total points earned in that role:

* Service Providers: 0.010284227825894100 LNT per point  
* App Publishers: 0.01957966588827020 LNT per point

Your individual allocation is the sum of your baseline amount plus your performance bonus (your points multiplied by the relevant multiplier).

**PLEASE NOTE:** These are initial plans only, which may change at any time for any reason.  This proposed formula is not binding in any way, to any party, including participants, service providers, or administrators of the LORO testnet.
